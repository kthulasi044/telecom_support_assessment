Telecom Support Assistant & Customer Profile Aggregator

This project demonstrates two key functionalities for a telecom provider:

 Task 1: An AI-powered Telecom Support Assistant that uses OpenAI function calling to answer customer queries and perform actions like fetching billing info, retrieving plan details, and filing complaints.

 Task 2: A Customer Info Aggregator that combines data from multiple internal APIs (Customer, Billing, Subscription) into a single profile response.

ðŸ“Œ Features Implemented
=> Task 1: Telecom Support Assistant
Built using OpenAI API with function calling.

Handles queries like:

Fetch billing information

Get current telecom plan

File a complaint (with issue details)

Dynamically routes queries to the correct tool:

getBillingInfo(customerId)

getPlanDetails(customerId)

fileComplaint(customerId, issue)

=> Task 2: Customer Info Aggregator
Exposes an endpoint GET /customer/:customerId/profile.

Fetches:

Customer Info â†’ /api/customer/:id

Billing Info â†’ /api/billing/:id

Subscription Info â†’ /api/subscription/:id

Uses Axios and Promise.allSettled() for concurrent API calls.

Handles partial failures gracefully by returning available data with error messages for missing parts.

 Tech Stack
Node.js (Express.js for API)

TypeScript

OpenAI API (for AI assistant)

Axios (for internal API calls)

Body-parser (for JSON parsing)
